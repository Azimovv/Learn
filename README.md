# Learn
This is simply a repo of all the things I have learned so far in Python

More files are added as I complete them


"GettingStarted" contains all the basic techniques I've learned

"data_visualization" contains files related to graphing data as well as obtaining data from various websites by
utilizing a scraper.

"first_game" contains my first game, a simple version of space invaders

"learning_log" is my first attempt at creating a web application. It's currently hosted on Heroku. It is a simple
memo/diary type of logging application used to store what has been learned about various topics

"scraper" contains a couple of web scrapers
